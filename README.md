# HospitalManagementSystem
A basic console-based Hospital Management System developed in Java, demonstrating fundamental database interactions using JDBC with a MySQL backend.This project serves as a practical example for learning CRUD operations, relational database concepts, and structured application design in Java.

Project Overview
The Hospital Management System is a simple command-line interface (CUI) application designed to manage essential hospital data: doctors, patients, and their appointments. It provides functionalities to add, view, update, and delete records for each entity, showcasing how Java applications can interact with a relational database.

This project is ideal for students and developers looking to understand:
*Java Database Connectivity (JDBC)
*Connecting Java applications to MySQL
*Implementing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations
*Basic object-oriented design (Model-DAO pattern)
*Handling user input in a console environment

Features
Doctor Management:
Add new doctor records (Name, Specialization, Phone, Email).
View a list of all registered doctors.
Update existing doctor details.
Delete doctor records.
Patient Management:
Add new patient records (Name, Age, Gender, Phone, Address).
View a list of all registered patients.
Update existing patient details.
Delete patient records.
Appointment Management:

Schedule new appointments, linking a patient to a doctor on a specific date and time.

View a list of all scheduled appointments.
Update existing appointment details.
Cancel (delete) appointments.
Console-Based Interface: All interactions are performed via the command line.

Technologies Used
Java: Core programming language.
JDBC (Java Database Connectivity): API for connecting to and executing queries against a database.
MySQL: Relational database management system for data storage.
MySQL Connector/J: The official JDBC driver for MySQL.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher:
MySQL Community Server:
MySQL Workbench (or any MySQL client like DBeaver, HeidiSQL): For database management and executing SQL queries.
